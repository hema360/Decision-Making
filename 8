Input consists of 3 integers and a string
The first input denotes the seating capacity of L1(a)
The second input denotes the seating capacity of L2(b)
The third input denotes the seating capacity of L3(c)
The fourth input denotes the lab which is allocated for ACE training
Output format:

PROGRAM:
# Get the seating capacities of the labs and the allocated lab
a = int(input("Enter the seating capacity of L1: "))
b = int(input("Enter the seating capacity of L2: "))
c = int(input("Enter the seating capacity of L3: "))

# Create a dictionary to hold the lab capacities
lab_capacities = {
    "L1": a,
    "L2": b,
    "L3": c
}

# Remove the allocated lab from the dictionary
if allocated_lab in lab_capacities:
    del lab_capacities[allocated_lab]

# Find the lab with the minimal seating capacity
min_lab = min(lab_capacities, key=lab_capacities.get)

# Print the lab with the minimal seating capacity
